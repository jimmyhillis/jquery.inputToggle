jQuery Input Toggle Plugin
==========================

This is a very simple (see _trivial_) plugin that I've found very useful
on a lot of websites. It allows you to keep the default values of an
input element on focus. On blur if the input value is empty it will put
the initial value back in. Can be useful in scenarios where the input
initial value describes what is required or has a hint within it.

## Usage

> $('input:text,textarea').inputToggle();

## Version

1.0.0 Working version with AMD requireJS support.
